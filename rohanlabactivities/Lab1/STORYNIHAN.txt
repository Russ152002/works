<h1>“The Tortoise and The Hare”.</h1>

<p>
<h3>First Paragraph:</h3>
once upon a time, there lived a hare. The hare could run very fast. It was proud of its speed.
One day, the hare saw the tortoise walk very slowly. The hare laughed at the tortoise and said,
“You are such a slowcoach!”. Then the tortoise replied, “My dear friend! You are so proud of
your speed. Let’s have a race to see who is faster.”
</p>

<p>
<h3>Second Paragraph:</h3>
<h4>So, the hare and the tortoise had a race. The hare ran very fast and very far. After a while, the
hare turned back to see where the tortoise was. The tortoise was walking very slowly, and it
was far behind the hare. “The tortoise will take a very long time to come near me,” the hare
thought.</h4>
</p>

<h3>Third Paragraph:</h3>
The hare started feeling bored. He thought to take a nap. In the meantime, he began to eat the
grass. After eating, he went to sleep. The tortoise slowly but steadily passed the hare. The hare
suddenly woke up and saw the tortoise just crossing the finishing line. The hare started running
very fast. But it was too late. The tortoise already won the race. The hare was extremely
disappointed to find his competitor already there as a winner.
